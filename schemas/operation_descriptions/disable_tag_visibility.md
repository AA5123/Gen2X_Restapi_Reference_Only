**Description:**
Clear Protected Mode Configuration — Revokes the reader's authorization to inventory protected tags, restoring them to invisible status.

**Usage:**
Send this command with the 32-bit access password to revoke the reader's visibility permissions. After sending this command, the reader will no longer surface protected tags in inventory results. This does not remove Protected Mode from the tags; it only prevents the reader from seeing them.

**Parameters (MQTT & REST):**

- **action** (string): Disables reading of protected tags Must be `disableTagVisibility`.
- **password** (string): 8-character hexadecimal 32-bit password
